Ever wanted to do DNSSEC validation in PHP?

This dnssec validator is written in 100% PHP5. It contains an object-oriented DNS module that can retrieve any record from a nameserver.

The validator has been tested extensively on .NL and .EU domain names, but not on other ones.

Please feel free to test, use, add or modify.
